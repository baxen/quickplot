## Contributing ##
Feel free to send pull requests to add material. Code will be added as is: no quality control. If you'd like to make ongoing changes, contact baxen90@gmail.com to get added as a collaborator. 

## Layout ##
For now, it seems like a good idea to imitate the package system from Athena/RootCore. So put pieces of code in a package folder, and for anything complicated use the standard subfolders (src, python, etc...).
